# Community Science Museum

This will be a fictional museum website for the Noroff Semster Project 1.
Its target audience are primary and middle school children of the age of 7-15 and families with young children.
The museum wants a website that is informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents.
The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent.
The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself.
The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.
